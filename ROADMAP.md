## Phase 1: Project Initialization (Q1 2024)

**Goal:** Set up the project environment and prepare the necessary infrastructure for development.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Setup Git Repository**: Create a Git repository for version control and collaboration.
- [ ] **Set Up Python Virtual Environment**: Configure virtual environment for managing dependencies.
- [ ] **Install Dependencies**: Install essential libraries and tools for the server (e.g., FastAPI, Uvicorn).
- [ ] **Initialize Database**: Set up the database (if applicable) for storing user data or logs.
- [ ] **Configure Server**: Set up server environment, including Nginx or other web servers (if necessary).

**Expected Completion:** January 2024

## Phase 2: Core Features Development (Q1 - Q2 2024)

**Goal:** Develop the core features of the voice-to-text server, including file upload, audio processing, and text conversion.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Voice to Text Conversion**: Integrate the voice recognition engine (e.g., Vosk or Whisper) and implement the voice-to-text conversion feature.
- [ ] **File Upload API**: Implement an API for users to upload audio files.
- [ ] **Text Retrieval API**: Develop an API to retrieve the converted text from uploaded audio files.
- [ ] **File Storage**: Set up file storage (local or cloud-based) to handle uploaded files.
- [ ] **User Feedback**: Provide feedback to users on successful uploads, conversion status, and errors.

**Expected Completion:** March 2024

## Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance (Q2 2024)

**Goal:** Ensure the application is stable, functional, and bug-free.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for the core functionality (e.g., voice-to-text conversion, file handling).
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test the integration of the voice-to-text API with the file upload functionality.
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Perform load testing to simulate multiple simultaneous users and large file uploads.
- [ ] **Bug Fixes**: Identify and resolve any bugs or performance issues discovered during testing.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document the codebase, including API documentation and error handling guides.

**Expected Completion:** April 2024

## Phase 4: Deployment & Release (Q3 2024)

**Goal:** Deploy the application to a production environment and ensure its scalability.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Set Up Production Server**: Configure the production server for hosting the application (e.g., Nginx, Docker, etc.).
- [ ] **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Set up a CI pipeline for automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions or similar.
- [ ] **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Configure automatic deployment to production after successful tests.
- [ ] **Deploy to Cloud**: Deploy the application to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, etc.) if necessary.
- [ ] **Production Monitoring**: Set up monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track server health, performance, and errors.

**Expected Completion:** June 2024

## Phase 5: Post-Launch Improvements (Q4 2024 and Beyond)

**Goal:** Improve the product based on user feedback and continue enhancing the server with additional features.

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Security Enhancements**: Perform a security audit of the application and address vulnerabilities.
- [ ] **Optimization**: Optimize the server for better performance (e.g., reduce latency, optimize file handling).
- [ ] **Additional Features**: Add advanced features like multiple language support, real-time transcription, or user authentication.
- [ ] **User Feedback Integration**: Collect and integrate user feedback for further improvements.
- [ ] **Refactoring**: Refactor the codebase for better maintainability and scalability.

**Expected Completion:** Ongoing after July 2024
